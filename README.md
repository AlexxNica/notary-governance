# Notary Governance
⚠️⚠️⚠️ ***This is still Work In Progress but one can follow the repository for the latest discussion and changes. If you are interested in becoming a Notary, please submit an issue in the repository so the maintainers can score according to the rubric and provide feedback.***

## Dispute / Audit Framework

## Governance and Iteration Process 
Within this repository are the governing documents, selection criteria, and processes for Notaries and Root Key Holders. Improvements to these documents and processes may be proposed via Pull Requests - where open discussion can happen asynchronously via the community. Similar to a FIP, any proposed changes must be done within the constraints of improving the Mechanisms and Operations to better meet the overarching Principles.

Please note our community governance calls will take place every other **Tuesday (starting 2020.11.10) at 5pm UTC**.
