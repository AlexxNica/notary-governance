# Notary Governance

The purpose of this repository is to manage the governance and evolution of specific Mechanisms and Operations of the program as insantiated in this [FIP](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0003.md) and illustrated in the following diagram.

## Dispute / Audit Framework

The process for filing a Dispute / Audit request is as follows: 
1. An issue must be filed detailing the following information: 
- Who is the Dispute / Audit request against? 

_The submission must include the on-chain addresses of the parties involved and the name of the Notary involved (if applicable)._

- Why is the request being filed?

_A concise description detailing the issue at hand. Notably some specific harm must be detailed (either a violation of the overarching principles, a violation of a Notary's own attested allocation plan, a violation of the agreed upon [operating guidelines](/notaries#operational-guidelines), or some other act of impropriety._

- What is the substantiating evidence? 

_Links to the relevant transaction ids or other substantiating evidence._

2. Once an issue has been filed, the community will review the submission to affirm the legitimacy of the claim. Issues that are not properly substantiated may require additional information or be closed. 

3. If an issue is filed and has substantial evidence, a Notary will have 5 days to provide a response in the same issue. 

4. Based on the evidence and the response, the community can adjudicate on the severity of the issue at hand at the next governance call - or pending an imminent need an emergency governance call may take place. If there is a flagrant violation of the Principles, operating guidelines, or other foundational items - a Notary may be subject to removal. If the violation is of a smaller scale, the Notary may simply be given a warning (and this repo may receive a PR to provide clarity for other Notaries). Auxillary information (including evidence that the Notary acted in good faith) should be considered as well. 


## Governance, Contributing and Iteration Process 
Within this repository are the governing documents, selection criteria, and processes for Notaries and Root Key Holders. Areas for discussion or improvement, should be filed as issues. Please use the Modification template (for proposed improvements) or create a blank issue for topics for discussion!

After community discussion, pull requests are encouraged where open discussion can happen asynchronously via the community - please be sure to link the relevant issues to the changes in your PR. Similar to a FIP, any proposed changes must be done within the constraints of improving the Mechanisms and Operations to better meet the overarching Principles.

Please note our community governance calls will take place every other Tuesday - alternating every meeting between 3pm UTC and 11pm UTC. Please see the community calendar for the accurate dates, follow the repo (where agenda issues will be filed), or join our Slack channel!
